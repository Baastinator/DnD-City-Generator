# DnD-City-Generator

basically i made a program for my group that randomly generates a DnD town with stats and a mayor which also have stats.
if anyone on the internet wants to use it they're free to, maybe even leave a comment so i know my work's being appreciated somewhere.
usage should be pretty self explanatory, build it with visual studio if i haven't uploaded a finished build yet.
